### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a machine learning engineer at a New York-based startup [Dime](https://www.joindime.io/). I work majorly on - a) setting up robust ETL pipelines, and b) building LLM and RAG-powered agentic (and non-agentic) systems focused on domain-specific (i.e. accounting, SME) enterprise use cases. Along with that, I do LLM and SLM fine-tuning on proprietary data.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine learning-based predictive analysis and textual Generative AI (LLM and RAG-based).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in depth about Advanced RAG techniques and distributed training in PyTorch.
